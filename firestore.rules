/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the JEE Prep Ace application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is based on a clear separation between public, read-only educational
 * content and private, user-specific data. It enforces a role-based access control (RBAC)
 * system, granting elevated write permissions to 'teacher' users for managing shared
 * learning materials. User data is strictly segregated and owned by the user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/...: Subcollections for user-specific data like test results and learning paths.
 * - /roles_teacher/{userId}: A lookup collection to identify users with the 'teacher' role.
 * - Top-level collections (e.g., /content, /topics, /live_classes): Shared educational
 *   materials accessible to all authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access is granted explicitly.
 * - User Privacy: Users can only access their own data within their `/users/{userId}` document tree.
 *   Listing all users is explicitly forbidden.
 * - Role-Based Content Management: Only users marked as teachers (via an entry in `/roles_teacher`)
 *   can create, update, or delete shared content like topics, questions, and mock tests. This
 *   prevents students from modifying the curriculum.
 * - Public Content Accessibility: All signed-in users (students and teachers) can read shared
 *   educational content to facilitate learning.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Ownership fields like 'studentId' and 'teacherId' are
 *   denormalized onto documents. This allows for fast, efficient security checks without
 *   requiring slow and costly `get()` calls to other documents for most rules.
 * - Structural Segregation: Private data (e.g., `test_results`) is stored in a user-specific
 *   subcollection, which is more secure and performant than storing it in a top-level
 *   collection with UID-based query rules.
